# RFP: `Impact DAOs Research + Book Project (Green Grant)` 

**Name of Project:** Impact DAOs Research + Book Project (A Decentralized Collaborative, Open Source Project) 

**RFP Category:** `docs`

**Proposer:** `deeparocks`

## Project Description

# Goal
We want to publish the seminal work on “How to Build an Impact DAO” and empower the next generation of builders in web3. We are researching experienced Impact DAO builders to unlock their learnings for new and struggling web3 entrants. We plan to publish our findings in a book on, “How to Build Impact DAOs”. The practical guidebook would show entrepreneurs how Impact DAOs operate so they can execute on their mission.

# Why study Impact DAOs
 
Impact DAOs have exploded in the last 6-9months. Web3 entities like Gitcoin have moved to a DAO model, traditional nonprofits like Big Green (of Kimbal Musk) are experimenting with DAOs and the new ones are launching DAO first to govern their platform and other offerings. We believe in the near future DAOs will become the most natural way to organize around causes. It's therefore important to equip the new web3 entrants with great documentation.

# How we plan to do it
 
This is a distributed collaborative project. We put out a call for collaborators https://cryptogood.substack.com/p/-call-for-contributors-a-study-of and have attracted global talent working at the intersection of web3 + media + social impact. We are studying 12 Impact DAOs (climate + social) in-depth through conversations with founders and contributors. Over the course of the study we plan to continuously share learnings as we study the DAOs. Our end goal is to publish an open source digital book that serves as a guidebook to web3 changemakers. We are also considering a print copy through NFT pre-orders. 

# Scope of the study

The research would involve interviewing founders and contributors to understand the DAO motivation, structure, tokenomics, governance, funding, tooling, deliverables and impact measurement criteria. We estimate a timeframe of about 3-4 months to study 12 Impact DAOs. More on our scope of study here https://twitter.com/deeparocks/status/1533866953864933376?s=20, our interview questions set here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bZ5YdymZl7MI2pi4TmwtTn8SqB9yyRYPa6xMDfycBL4/edit 

# Current Status

1. We’ve selected the 12 Impact DAOs for our study - Gitcoin DAO, Dream DAO, Human DAO, GoodDollar DAO, Proof of Humanity, Impact Market DAO, Klima DAO, Regen Network, All for Climate DAO, Commons Stack, Pact DAO (great model for cities), Ukraine DAO (great model for disaster aid). You can learn more about our qualifying criteria and selection process here https://cryptogood.substack.com/p/how-we-picked-the-10-impact-daos
2. We are at the end of our research interviews. Only 5 more remaining out of 36 one on one 60mins interviews with experienced DAO contributors and builders.
3. We’ve started publishing our interviews under creative commons license. 4/36 articles published here https://cryptogood.substack.com/s/impact-daos-research?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=menu

4. For this project we’ve been operating as a DAO since May 24th, 2022. We’ve opened a multi-sig and are collaborating on Discord. I write about our DAO journey here https://cryptogood.substack.com/p/learnings-on-building-a-dao-from
We participated in Gitcoin Grant Round 14 under DEI and Climate category. Our project was deeply buried in the 2000+ grants on the platform, 142 people still found us and donated. We raised $8250 in matching grants from Gitcoin. The initial grant helped us buy the subscription services we needed and pay a small allowance to the team to get work done.

## Value

Impact DAOs space is a young but a fast growing space. Changemakers are building in web3 for its speed and scale and zero bureaucracy. Web3 allows them to immediately focus on the cause at hand.
 
We’d love Filecoin’s support to grow this young but ambitious regenerative side of crypto. Our goal is to be a media house for Impact DAOs. We'll create awareness about the work of Filecoin and its distributed storage infrastructure. We see a great potential in Impact DAOs using Filecoin to preserve truth and facts. This project will provide great documentation to newcomers on how to build and make impact using crypto and web3 tools.


## Deliverables

1. 30-40 interview write-ups + podcast
2. Digital book - How to Build Impact DAOs
3. Print book through NFT pre-orders on Mirror

*After the book, to keep knowledge updated we plan to continue interviewing Impact DAO builders and share their learnings as Q&As. 
Launch a magazine to showcase Impact DAO people + work + culture + vibe. We are inspired by Thrasher print magazine that showcases skateboarding culture. Also the magazine has one price both in the US and Canada which is $5 for loads of stories and inspiration. We like that about Thrasher making knowledge affordable and accessible.*


## Recommended Team

We are operating as a DAO. We are a core team of 15 members that organizes and reorganizes based on the tasks and evolving needs. We also seek out experts based on the specialized nature of the task. For instance, we recently recruited an expert in Organization Design to help us see the emerging patterns in the future of work, a design expert from an NYC branding agency to help us articulate our brand story + media assets. We also have a project management, data analysis and infographic expert. 

We are a women-led, men supported global team spanning age, gender, race and culture. A collective of folks working at the intersection of web3 + impact + media. Our team includes writers, podcasters, researchers, published authors, social entrepreneurs, climate activists, web3 developers, designers and Dream DAO Gen Z members from across the world.

## About the Project Initiator 

I @deeparocks (Deepa) initiated this project. I have over a decade of experience in the social impact sector across multiple countries. I started my career in India where I was part of the  founding team of United Way’s first ever chapter in the country. I had the privilege to work directly with the Board of Directors that included CEOs of Citibank, AT Kearney, JP Morgan, Mahindra and Mahindra and the likes. I also did my Masters in Social Studies from India’s leading Tata Institute of Social Sciences. 

I later moved to Singapore and fundraised (including from Singapore Govt EDB) for the World Toilet Organization and subsequently headed Salesforce.com’s Integrated Philanthropy Program for Asia-Pacific. I also did a program in Social Entrepreneurship from INSEAD Singapore. 

Later when I moved to California I launched my own publication profiling social entrepreneurs at the intersection of technology and social good. The publication was mentioned twice in the Forbes and Inc magazine for the best in women and entrepreneurship category. 

I got into web3 last year in May 2021 when Vitalik Buterin donated 1 Billion to India’s Crypto Relief Fund. It made me start looking at crypto from the social impact lens. I wrote about my journey into crypto here https://cryptogood.substack.com/p/how-i-got-hooked-on-crypto?s=w and link to my publication CryptoGood https://cryptogood.substack.com/

The rest of the team’s profile can be looked up on Twitter in their bio and twitter feed which is more updated than LinkedIn. But they are some of the best. Women are at the forefront leading this initiative. We have Yvonne, a design strategist from NY Times, Abeera from UNICEF Innovation Fund, Katerina researcher and scientist from RnDAO, Kim, Chief Knowledge Officer at Zaman International and the likes.

## Detailed Requirements & Constraints

The only constrain this project has is with funds. We have tons of community support. From day one we've been building with the community. We did a Gitcoin fundraiser previously, 142 people found our deeply buried project on Gitcoin and helped us raise $8k+ in funding. The project is super popular and has started to unpack tons of learnings around DAOs and Impact DAOs.

## Milestones & Funding

Since this project is midway, the previous stages were
1. Call for Contributors May 22nd: Contributors needed to apply to participate
2. Launched DAO May 24th on Zoom and set-up a Discord
3. Phase1: Preparation (May 24th - June 21st): Gitcoin Fundraising + defined scope of study + Interview Questionnaire + Outlined Book Chapters + selected the 12 DAOs based on intensive research and thought
4. Phase2: Knowledge Gathering (June 21st to Aug 19th): 12 DAO Founder + Contributors 60mins long interviews with an average of 3 interviews per DAO. We’ll have in total 36-40 authentic conversations on DAO matters. Also knowledge gathering around chapters

### Filecoin's funds will help us with Phase 3 and 4, detailed breakdown as below

#### Phase3: Data Analysis and Writing Book Chapters
1. Extract data from raw conversations as per the line of inquiry here https://twitter.com/deeparocks/status/1533866953864933376?s=20
2. Miro board analysis for free thining and looking at patterns emerging across DAOs and future of work. Our OD experts will be guiding us through this process
3. Quantitative Analysis in Google Spreadheet and statistical modelling + infographcis by our DAO mate
4. Writing book chapters

Chapter 1: What are DAOs (Def/History/Evolution/What makes them different/Current landscape etc)
Chapter 2: what are Imapct DAOs and the current landscape
Chapter 3: 12 Case Studies
Chapter 4: Key Learnings (Broad Areas - Motivation, Structure, Governance, Tokenomics, Tooling and Security, Impact Mesaurement). Current Challenges and Recommendation
Chapter 5: Impact DAO Ecosystem Resources - List of Funding, Accelerators, Enablers, etc
Chapter 6: Closing Notes with a high on the defining characteristics of the future of work
Appendix: The DAO Glossary, breaking down all the terms for new web3 entrants

We estimate this phase to go on till September 18th

#### Phase 4: Final Push to Publish (Sept 19 - Sept 30th) 
1. Lots of proofreading, editing, re-organizing. We are inspired by Stephen King's book, On Writing https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816 and will use similar writing sytle which is conversational. Also similar to Hemingway, we will be using Hemingway Editor https://hemingwayapp.com/ to keep it simple with short sentences so that even a Grade 6th student can understand

2. Website: We are inspired by Balaji's The Network State book website and will model ours on it https://thenetworkstate.com/

3. Mirror NFT Pre book order: We will take pre-orders for the print book on Mirror similar to this one suggested to us by Ethereum Foundation https://stateful.mirror.xyz/-NLDSw0mA2vjtvqQYpXBOa3H38HXMmIdaw2KwI1A0y8

4. Since the book sales will lead to taxes and stuff we plan to register a company in Canada and bring on board accountant to deal with sales tax etc
5. POAP for contributiors, donors and everyone that helped bring this book to reality. SBTs for contributiors, we are in touch with Otterspace https://twitter.com/otterspace_xyz building the SBT rails.

The above is the roadmap upto book publishing. In order to keep the knowledge updated we aim to continuously interview DAO Builders based on our initial set of criteria and showcase their work + culture + vibe. We plan to launch a digital magazine and a  print magazine (bi-annual print). I’m consulting with the best in this space on the art of producing a print magazine.
